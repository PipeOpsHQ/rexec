# Rexec AI Manifest

## About Rexec

name: Rexec
tagline: Terminal as a Service - Instant Linux terminals in your browser
description: Rexec is a cloud-based platform that provides instant-access Linux terminals in the browser, powered by Docker containers. It enables collaborative development environments, remote agent support, and real-time terminal session recording and playback.

## Core Capabilities

- Instant Linux terminal access via browser (no installation required)
- Docker-backed sandboxed execution environments
- Remote agent support for connecting existing servers and infrastructure
- Real-time terminal session recording and playback
- WebSocket-based terminal streaming with xterm.js
- Multi-user collaborative terminal sessions
- Supervised AI agent execution (Collaborative Intelligence)
- CLI and TUI tools for terminal management
- Enterprise-grade security with JWT authentication

## Technology Stack

backend: Go 1.24+ with Gin framework, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker SDK
frontend: Svelte 5 with TypeScript, Vite, xterm.js
infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose, multi-region capable
authentication: JWT with passcode support
billing: Stripe integration

## Primary Use Cases

1. Collaborative Intelligence - AI agents execute code in supervised, sandboxed terminals
2. Remote Development - Access development environments from anywhere
3. DevOps Automation - Run deployment scripts and maintenance tasks
4. Education & Training - Provide consistent terminal environments for students
5. Code Review & Debugging - Shared terminal sessions for pair programming
6. CI/CD Integration - Execute build and test pipelines
7. System Administration - Manage remote servers through a unified interface
8. Ephemeral Testing Environments - Spin up temporary containers for testing
9. Live Demonstrations - Record and replay terminal sessions for documentation
10. Interview & Assessment - Provide candidates with coding environments

## AI Integration

Rexec supports "Collaborative Intelligence" - a supervised model where AI agents (like Claude, GPT, or custom agents) can:
- Execute code in sandboxed Docker containers
- Access terminal sessions via WebSocket API
- Run commands with human oversight
- Generate and test code in real-time environments
- Collaborate with human developers in shared sessions

AI agents can integrate via:
1. WebSocket API for terminal access
2. REST API for container lifecycle management
3. Remote agent protocol for connecting custom infrastructure

## Security & Privacy

- All containers run in isolated Docker environments
- JWT-based authentication with secure token rotation
- Passcode support for additional security layers
- Session recordings are private by default
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure with SOC2 compliance (planned)
